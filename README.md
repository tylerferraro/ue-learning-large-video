# Unreal Engine Learning Large Video Chrome Extension

This chrome extension modifies the css on the Unreal Engine course pages to be larger. The code for this plugin is simplistic and not meant to be used long term. Please file an issue if you notice it no longer works. The project was meant for me but I thougt I'd share in case others wanted to use it.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to use the extension follow these steps:

1. Download this project into a directory
2. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions
3. Drag this project folder into chrome
4. Enjoy learning with larger videos!
